        title: "How much does BusinessChat's subscription costs?",
        answer: `BusinessChat has a Starter and a Professional Plan. The cost of each plan depends on the number of conversations you send every month.
        For the starter Plan, the fixed cost is $100 per month and $11 per extra 1000 conversation as a variable cost, that you pay at the end of the month. (the starter plan includes 1000 free conversations).
        The advantage with our pricing model is that you don't have to select a certain amount of conversations or contacts per month. In any given month, you only pay for your consumption of conversations and nothing more. For more details visit our pricing page.`
